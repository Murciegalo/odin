# Starter-Kit-2018


So I built this for all the new web developers... My Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.

**Steps**
---------

 **Install Node**
	https://nodejs.org/en/

**Download Atom**
	https://atom.io/

 **Install all the node packages**
On the root of this project run on your terminal (if you want you can do this with yarn but thats optional)

    npm install

 **Update the node packages**
On the root of this project run on your terminal (if you want you can do this with yarn but thats optional)

    npm update


**Start the server**

  npm run watch
